# Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering with UMAP
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate advanced machine learning techniques, focusing on dimensionality reduction using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) followed by applications in clustering and classification.

## Notebooks
### 1. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
Description: This notebook provides a comprehensive overview and application of various dimensionality reduction techniques including PCA (Principal Component Analysis), SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), MDS (Multidimensional Scaling), ISOMap, LLE (Locally Linear Embedding), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), and UMAP.
Key Concepts:
Theoretical understanding of each technique.
Application on sample datasets (e.g., Iris dataset).
Visualization of dimensionality reduction results.
Insights into the effectiveness and limitations of each method.
#### Committed Colab notebook

### 2. UMAP for Clustering and Classification
Description: This notebook illustrates how the UMAP algorithm can be effectively used for dimensionality reduction, followed by clustering (using KMeans) and classification as a feature extraction technique.
Key Concepts:
Application of UMAP on a complex dataset (e.g., MNIST).
Clustering of the UMAP-reduced data.
Using UMAP-reduced data for training a classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machine).
Evaluation of clustering and classification results.
Installation and Usage
To run these notebooks, you need to have Python installed, along with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. You also need the following Python libraries:
#### Committed Colab Notebook

### 3. Demonstrate dimensionality reduction using data bricks
Implements dimensionality reduction in Databricks.
Includes data preprocessing and PCA application.
Features visualizations of reduced datasets.
Provides performance analysis and insights.
Contains Databricks notebooks for easy replication.
#### Committed files to github
